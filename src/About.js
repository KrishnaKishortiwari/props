<p className="text-success">Posted on September 7, 2016 in Blog
Think about the last time you were shopping on the internet. If you were looking for something specific, chances are you bounced around from site to site a bit to find the perfect item. But what made you bounce?

Forty-seven percent of web users say that they’ll leave a site if it doesn’t load in two seconds or less – and 79 percent of users who abandon a site with poor load time won’t return again. Ever. (Source: Kissmetrics) This is detrimental for conversions, for obvious reasons.

Dive in to page load time with us to understand why and how to make sure your site isn’t losing customers by being too slow.

Page Load Time
What is page load time?
Page load time is how long it takes for a page on a website to fully display its content. Pretty straight-forward, right? Right.

“Page load time” is one of two subcategories under “page speed,” the other of which is “time to first byte” or how long it takes for your browser to receive the first byte of information from the web server.

We’re focusing on page load time for the purposes of this article, however, because:

Page load time affects users directly, whereas time to first byte is not a noticeable concept for the average web user.
Page speed is often confused with site speed. To be clear, there is a difference between page load time and site speed. Site speed is page load time – page speed – compounded. It is the average speed of a sample of page views on a site.
Why should I care about page load time?
Page load time is important for two reasons:

We humans want things fast. A recent survey showed that nearly half of web users will abandon an online purchase if the page or site loads too slowly. In 2016, users expect pages to load within 2 seconds.
In short, if your pages aren’t loading at the speed of light, chances are you’re losing customers just as quickly.

Robots expect other robots to get on their level. In 2010, Google told us that site speed is a factor in search engine rankings. This is where “time to first byte” comes in to play. While it is not necessarily the most critical of signals (by comparison to, say, page content relevance), site speed, page load time and time to first byte should still be taken into consideration when optimizing a site for search. Google is using the metrics as a way to gauge usability on your site to determine where your pages should fall on the SERP.
And we all know that those search engine results are pretty speedy.</p>
